# Elomoas — LMS & Online Courses HTML Template

## Project Overview

**Elomoas** is a modern, responsive HTML template tailored for e-learning: online courses, bootcamps, academies, tutoring platforms and course marketplaces. It emphasizes clarity, trust (instructor highlights, reviews), and conversion (course cards, trial CTAs, enrollment flows). The repository contains the full front-end source, assets, documentation, and a clear path to integrate with an LMS back-end or headless CMS for production use.

## Value Proposition

* **Conversion-focused UX:** Course discovery, instructor credibility, and clear pricing paths to boost enrollments.
* **Learner-first design:** easy access to syllabus, instructor bios, curriculum previews, and reviews.
* **Scalable:** static front-end ready to connect to any backend (Node, Laravel, Django, Supabase) or a headless CMS.
* **Quick-to-market:** swap branding, add content, connect payments and go live.

---

## Key Features & Highlights

* Responsive, mobile-first layout with course catalog and detail pages.
* Instructor pages, curriculum/lesson breakdowns, student reviews, and certificate placeholders.
* Course filters (category, level, price), search, and featured courses blocks.
* Enrollment forms and payment-ready integrations (front-end hooks).
* Promotional banners, FAQ, blog/articles, and contact pages.
* Optimized assets (SVGs, responsive images), lazy-loading structure.
* SEO-friendly markup and meta suggestions for course schema.

---

## Tech Stack (Implemented / Recommended)

**Front-end**

* HTML5 (semantic)
* CSS3 (variables) — supports Sass/SCSS for maintainability
* JavaScript (ES6+) — modular components for search, filters, and UI behaviors
* Optional: jQuery (if template includes legacy scripts)
* Layout: CSS Grid + Flexbox; compatible with Bootstrap or Tailwind if you prefer

**Development tooling**

* Visual Studio Code (recommended)
* Node.js + npm for build tooling (Sass, autoprefixer, imagemin, dev server)
* Build: Vite / webpack / gulp — pick based on your stack

**Back-end / Integrations (suggested)**

* Fullstack: React + Node/Express + Postgres (or MongoDB)
* PHP: Laravel + MySQL with Blade/Vue admin
* Serverless / BaaS: Next.js + Supabase/Firebase for rapid prototyping

> This repo contains the static front-end. Back-end & LMS integrations are provided as guides and API stubs.

---

## Development Workflow & Tools

Recommended setup:

1. Install Node.js (LTS) and npm.
2. Use VS Code with extensions: Live Server, Prettier, ESLint, EditorConfig, GitLens.
3. Add dev dependencies for Sass, PostCSS (autoprefixer), imagemin, and a dev server.
4. Use Prettier + ESLint + stylelint to keep code quality high.

---

## How to run locally

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/elomoas-template.git
cd elomoas-template

# If using tooling
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# or
npx live-server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown by your dev server).

---

## NPM Scripts (example)

Add to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "live-server ./ --port=3000 --open=./index.html",
  "sass": "sass --watch scss:css --style=expanded",
  "build:css": "sass scss:css --style=compressed && postcss css/*.css --use autoprefixer -d dist/css",
  "optimize:images": "imagemin src/images/* --out-dir=dist/images",
  "build": "npm run build:css && npm run optimize:images"
}
```

## Admin Panel — Design & Implementation Plan (LMS)

To transform the static template into a full LMS platform, build an Admin Panel (Instructor & Admin dashboards) with the following capabilities.

### Core Goals

* Course CRUD: create courses, modules, lessons, quizzes, resources, price models.
* Instructor management: approve instructors, manage profiles, payouts.
* Student management: enrollments, progress tracking, certificates.
* Sales & payments: orders, refunds, coupon management, revenue reports.
* Content moderation: course approvals, reviews moderation, reporting.
* Analytics: course completion rates, revenue, top-performing courses.

### Recommended Stacks (choose one)

* **Option A (JS Fullstack):** Next.js (Admin & Frontend) + Node/Express API + Postgres + Redis (caching)
* **Option B (Laravel):** Laravel + Nova/Filament for Admin + MySQL
* **Option C (Serverless):** Next.js Admin + Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

## Data Model (Simplified)

```
users: id, name, email, role [student,instructor,admin], password_hash, profile, avatar
courses: id, title, slug, description, category_id, price, level, status, cover_image, author_id
modules: id, course_id, title, order
lessons: id, module_id, title, content_type [video,article,quiz], content_url, duration
quizzes: id, lesson_id, questions[{q, options, answer}]
enrollments: id, user_id, course_id, progress, started_at, completed_at
orders: id, user_id, course_id, amount, status, payment_provider, created_at
reviews: id, user_id, course_id, rating, comment, created_at
certificates: id, user_id, course_id, issued_at, certificate_url
coupons: code, discount_type, value, expires_at, usage_limit
```

## Admin UI Features & Notes

**Key Admin/Instructor features**

* Role-based access control (Admin, Instructor, Support)
* Course builder with drag/order support for modules and lessons
* Media uploads (videos, PDFs) to cloud storage (S3 or similar)
* Quiz builder and auto-grading (for objective questions)
* Progress tracker per student and per course
* Payout and earnings dashboard for instructors
* Webhooks for payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, local gateways)

**Implementation tips**

* Use presigned URLs for direct uploads to S3 to avoid server overload.
* For video hosting, integrate with a VOD provider (Vimeo, Mux) or store on cloud storage + CDN.
* Use background workers (e.g., Bull/Redis) for heavy tasks: video processing, certificate generation, emails.

## Customization Guide (Quick Wins for Clients)

* **Branding:** change CSS variables or `_variables.scss` (primary color, accent, fonts).
* **Course content:** edit static JSON or wire up to an API to render dynamic course lists.
* **Instructor bios & trust:** add instructor photos and testimonials on course pages to increase conversions.
* **Promotions:** add limited-time discounts and coupon codes to increase sign-ups.
* **Forms:** hook enrollment/payment forms to your backend or serverless function with server-side validation.

---

## Performance, SEO & Accessibility

* **Performance:** responsive `<picture>`, `loading="lazy"`, minify CSS/JS, use WebP images and a CDN.
* **SEO:** semantic HTML, meta tags, Open Graph, course schema (Course, EducationalOrganization).
* **Accessibility:** alt text, keyboard navigation, ARIA landmarks for complex widgets, sufficient contrast.

---

## Deployment Recommendations & CI/CD

**Static Front-end:** Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for fast hosting. Use a CDN for assets.

**Admin/API:** containerize (Docker) and deploy on managed platforms (DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS Fargate, Heroku, Render). Use managed DB (Cloud SQL, RDS, Supabase).

**CI/CD example (GitHub Actions)**

* Build assets and run tests on push to `main`.
* Deploy `dist/` to Netlify/Vercel or push Docker image to registry and deploy to cloud.

---

## Security & Privacy

* Enforce HTTPS and HSTS.
* Validate and sanitize inputs server-side.
* Use strong password hashing (bcrypt/argon2) and secure cookies/JWT best practices.
* Protect uploads and media with signed URLs.
* GDPR/Privacy: provide data export & deletion endpoints and a cookie/privacy policy.
